For your final docker challenge you will be tasked with the below. 

I want you to create a docker file that compiles the go source code found in `products/final/src`. You should place the go source code into /bin/go/api on an alpine linux container. I would like you to build the source code in one stage and place it on the alpine linux container after it is compiled. 

This challenge will show that you are capable of crafting multi staged container builds.
