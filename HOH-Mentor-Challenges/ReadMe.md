# Mentor Challenges Repo

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to provide challenges that will improve upon your devops skills. Every Week there will be new challenges that we will discuss. You work in the cohort will begin to become more taxing so there is no expectation that you complete everyone of these challenges. Every week we will talk through your work and expand on where you can improve you skills in different domains
